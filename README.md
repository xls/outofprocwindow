# outofprocwindow
na√Øve sample app to test out of proc opengl and the consequences of terminating processes with allocated opengl/GDI resources.

the test application will spawn N number of processes that attaches to the main window; from which each will allocate a number of textures of specified size and render a cube while binding and enumerating all textures allocated. These processes will be terminated at the interval set by respawn time (in seconds).

Default configurations are 3 process, 10 texture of each 4096x4096x4 bytes (square 4096px RGBA) and killed/respawn at an interval of 3seconds.

prebuilt binaries available in [Releases](https://github.com/xls/outofprocwindow/releases)
